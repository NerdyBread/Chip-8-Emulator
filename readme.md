## Hopefully Coming Soon

- Disassembler
- Other screen modes and the Super Chip added instructions

## Thoughts

This is my first real "resume worthy" project I would say. I'm actually proud of it and excited for my next step.
I tried to tackle this a number of years ago, but it didn't go well.
I didn't test well nor did I know how too, and I relied far too much on doing exactly what my resources did, even when I knew on a 
gut level that it may not have been the best way.
I'm beyond happy with the way I did it this time, and the rush I got when the code that I truly wrote was running any ROM I threw at
it felt so good.
